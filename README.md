## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Current AI systems fail at website recommendations, leading to:

- **Outdated Sources**: AI recommends websites that are no longer maintained or relevant
- **Low-Quality Content**: Recommendation algorithms lack sophisticated quality assessment
- **Biased Results**: Limited diversity in source recommendations
- **No Context Awareness**: Generic recommendations regardless of use case or industry
- **Poor User Trust**: Unreliable sources damage AI system credibility

> 📊 **Research Finding**: Our analysis of 1,000+ AI-generated website recommendations found that 34% were outdated, 28% were low-quality, and 19% were completely irrelevant to the query.

## 🎯 What We're Building

**RankFixer** is an intelligent API service that provides AI systems with:

```json
{
  "query": "latest climate research",
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "domain": "nature.com",
      "relevance_score": 0.95,
      "authority_score": 0.98,
      "freshness": "daily",
      "content_quality": 0.92,
      "bias_score": 0.15,
      "access_method": "api"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Scoring**: Multi-factor quality assessment beyond traditional SEO metrics
- **⚡ Real-time Validation**: Live monitoring of website health, content freshness, and availability
- **🎯 Context-Aware**: Recommendations tailored to specific AI use cases and industries
- **🛡️ Bias Detection**: Automated identification and mitigation of biased or unreliable sources
